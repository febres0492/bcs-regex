## Understanding the Password Strength Validation

Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching in strings. In this tutorial, we will break down a regex pattern used for validating strong passwords.

## Summary

We will explore the regex pattern used for password strength validation. This pattern ensures that a password contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character, with a minimum length of 8 characters.  

Here is the regex pattern:
```
^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$
```
