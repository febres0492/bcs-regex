## Understanding the Password Strength Validation

Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching in strings. In this tutorial, we will break down a regex pattern used for validating strong passwords.

## Summary

We will explore the regex pattern used for password strength validation. This pattern ensures that a password contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character, with a minimum length of 8 characters.  

Here is the regex pattern:
```
^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$
```

## Regex Components

### Anchors  

Anchors are used to ensure the regex matches from the start or end of a string.

^: Asserts the position at the start of the string.
$: Asserts the position at the end of the string.
In our regex, ^ ensures the match starts at the beginning, and $ ensures it ends at the end.

### Quantifiers  

Quantifiers specify how many times an element in a regex should be matched.

`{8,}`: Matches 8 or more of the preceding token.
In our regex, `{8,}` ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.

### OR Operator  

The OR operator `|` is not used in this regex.

### Character Classes  
Character classes match any one of the characters inside them.

`[a-z]`: Matches any lowercase letter.
`[A-Z]`: Matches any uppercase letter.
`\d`: Matches any digit.
`[@$!%*?&]`: Matches any of the specified special characters.
